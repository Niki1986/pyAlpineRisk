# pyAlpineRisk
Natural hazard management of alpine torrents.

In a time of increasing meteorological extreme events, high-resolution terrain models are an important tool for managing natural hazards. Combining simplified models of the terrain with different spatial analysis methods, various information and parameters can be obtained, which make it easier to answer specific hydrological questions. pyAlpineRisk is a Python-based toolset that can be used in natural hazard management to support a variety of workflows. The collection of tools ranges from the first assessment of torrent catchments to the classification of torrents and the utilization of sediment material.
